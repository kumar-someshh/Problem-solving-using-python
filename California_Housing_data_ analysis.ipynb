Let's dive into the concept of the **bias term** in a way that's easy to understand.\n","\n","Imagine you're trying to predict something, like how much a house will cost based on its size, number of bedrooms, and other features. You decide to use a mathematical model to make this prediction. One common type of model is called **linear regression**.\n","\n","Now, let's break it down:\n","\n","1. **Linear Regression**:\n","   - Linear regression is like drawing a straight line through a scatterplot of data points. It's a simple way to find a relationship between an input (like house size) and an output (like house price).\n","   - The goal is to find the best-fitting line that predicts the output based on the input features.\n","\n","2. **The Line Equation**:\n","   - In linear regression, we use an equation for the line. It looks like this:\n","     ```\n","     predicted_output = slope * input_feature + bias\n","     ```\n","   - Here:\n","     - **Slope**: Represents how much the output changes for a one-unit change in the input feature. It's like the steepness of the line.\n","     - **Bias**: This is what we're talking about! The bias is like the starting point of the line. It's where the line crosses the vertical axis (y-axis).\n","     - Together, the slope and bias determine the position and angle of the line.\n","\n","3. **Why Do We Need a Bias?**:\n","   - Imagine you're predicting house prices. If you didn't have a bias, the line would always pass through the origin (0,0) on the graph.\n","   - But in reality, houses have a minimum price even if they're tiny. That's where the bias comes in!\n","   - The bias allows the line to shift up or down, adjusting for the minimum price (or any other starting point) that makes sense.\n","\n","4. **Analogies**:\n","   - Think of the bias as the **base price** for houses. Even if a house has zero bedrooms (input feature), it still costs something because of the land, location, and other factors.\n","   - Or imagine you're baking cookies. The bias is like the **fixed cost** of ingredients (flour, sugar, etc.) before you even start adding chocolate chips or nuts (the slope).\n","\n","5. **In Summary**:\n","   - The bias helps our model account for things that don't depend on the input features. It's like the starting point or the minimum value.\n","   - Without the bias, our predictions might be way off because we'd be ignoring this essential starting point.\n","\n","So, next time you hear about the bias term in machine learning, remember it's like the base price or the fixed cost that ensures our model starts from the right place. 🏠📏\n"],"metadata":{"id":"m60IBSHwZAW8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Q5\n","If we use StandardScaler for preprocessing and LinearRegression for fitting the model with training set obtained from following code snippet:\n","\n","\n","Assume that (X,y) is the california housing dataset.\n","\n","- What is the R squared value for predictions obtained using test set features?\n","- what is the root mean squared error value for predictions obtained using test set features?\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ewpqj4yn2kDW"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error\n","y_pred= model.predict(X_test_norm) #prediction on normalized data\n","r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)\n","print(\"R squared value for predictions obtained using test set features\",r2)\n","\n","\n","MSE= mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)\n","print(\"root mean squared error value for predictions obtained using test set features\", np.sqrt(MSE))\n"],"metadata":{"id":"at81iCnV3EwK","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709576166488,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":620,"user":{"displayName":"Somesh kumar","userId":"06176946323739025588"}},"outputId":"fee56b5c-424b-4aae-80b7-b76fe3014c35"},"execution_count":87,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["R squared value for predictions obtained using test set features 0.6605140591531986\n","root mean squared error value for predictions obtained using test set features 0.7033383507521884\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Q6\n","\n","- Explained Variance score\n","- Max Error\n","- Mean Absolute Error\n","- Mean Squared Error\n"],"metadata":{"id":"VC5rYWRlfqYu"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.metrics import explained_variance_score\n","EVS= explained_variance_score(y_test, y_pred)\n","print(\"EVS\", EVS)\n","\n","from sklearn.metrics import max_error\n","ME= max_error(y_test,y_pred)\n","print(\"ME\", ME)\n","\n","from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error\n","MAE= mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)\n","print(\"MAE\", MAE)\n","\n","\n","print(\"MSE\", MSE)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"NkteKPIzsNXw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709576746185,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":518,"user":{"displayName":"Somesh kumar","userId":"06176946323739025588"}},"outputId":"ced59930-9628-416e-d3a1-8d910553e898"},"execution_count":90,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["EVS 0.6605500501742696\n","ME 7.2604532929585535\n","MAE 0.5168526993787044\n","MSE 0.4946848356388085\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Q7\n","\n","Perform SGD Regression on the given (scaled using StandardScalar()) dataset, using default hyperparameters and random_state=0.\n","\n","- What is the bias term?\n","- What are the coefficients in predicted model?"],"metadata":{"id":"-DAGbOXwr6v5"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor\n","sgd = SGDRegressor(random_state=0)\n","sgd.fit(X_train_norm,y_train)\n","print(sgd.coef_,\"\\n\")\n","print(sgd.intercept_)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"CAm3QhVFr_E1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709577086530,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":413,"user":{"displayName":"Somesh kumar","userId":"06176946323739025588"}},"outputId":"294e3460-7727-41cb-ef3d-31b847bfc26f"},"execution_count":95,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[ 0.84046697  0.112331   -0.41213039  0.21595971 -0.01781887 -0.01480892\n"," -0.87394103 -0.83913104] \n","\n","[2.01123921]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"W_tkfTZauuXC"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
